      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am currently a Behavior Specialist in an elementary school and need a change!</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I was born in Amarillo, TX but grew up in Methuen, MA and Hampstead, NH</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>In my free time I like to play soccer.  I am also into all those murder shows on Netflix!</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>That's a loaded question - I am looking for a change and hoping that this class will open up some new doors for me so I can figure out what I want to be when I grow up!</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Manchester, NH</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I want to challenge myself.  I had an interest in coding when I was in high school but decided to go into education instead.  I am needing a change in careers and I thought doing something with computers would be more statisfying for me at this point in my life.</p>
